# captalys-api

## To maintainer of this project

In order to distribute the template, you need to run `lein install`
and watchout to not provide a SNAPSHOT version because it seems like
leiningen has a bug to deal with it.

After that, run `lein deploy clojars`.

It might be necessary to add the plugin to your
`~/.lein/profile.clj` file depending on your Leiningen
version.

`{:user {:plugins [[captalys-api-template "0.1.5"]]}}`

For leiningen 2.x it will download the jar from Clojars if
not found.


## To users of this template

### Usage

`lein new captalys-api <new-project-name>`
